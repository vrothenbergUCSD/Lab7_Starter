/** Some hints for this router:
  *   - it shouldn't be a terribly long file, each function is pretty short.
  *   - the functions being passed in should mostly be stored so that
  *     you can call them later when you want to navigate to a page
  *   - you should be pushing to history (only when the 'popstate' event
  *     hasn't fired) so that you can use forward / backward buttons
  *   - You should be using hashes to update the URL (e.g. 
  *     https://somewebsite.com#somePage) - the hash is the #somePage part.
  *     It's accessible via window.location.hash and using them lets you
  *     easily modify the URL without refreshing the page or anything
